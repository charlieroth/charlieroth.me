# Charles Roth

## CarbonCloud

[carboncloud.com](https://carboncloud.com/)

When: `December 2023 - Present`

Location: `Gothenburg, Sweden`

Position: `Software Engineer`

I am a member of the engineering team whose goal is building web-based
applications for companies to organize and optimize their food supply chain
emissions. More specifically, I am a member of _The Plumbers_, who maintain
following applications:

- _CarbonCloud Platform_: 2nd generation service for food retailers to both
  manage their own product emissions but also engage with their retailers to
  create a granular understanding of what and where their emissions come from.
- _Luigi_: An API and data pipeline to consume and provide data for _CarbonCloud
  Platform_ & customers

The technical aspects of my work include:

- Creating new and maintaining legacy features of our web applications using
  mainly [React](https://react.dev/).
- Working closely with our UX team to create a design system that effectively
  tells the story of a customer's supply chain emission data.
- Writing backend services in Python, using
  [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and
  [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), that maintain a both a public
  database and customer specific databases of products whose emissions,
  regarding agricultural data, can be modeled.
- Writing backend services in Go, using [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com) and
  [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), that maintains a public database of
  customer products, supply-chain transportation, energy usage, packaging and
  product recipes.

## Bzzt AB

When: `June 2023 - November 2023`

Location: `Gothenburg, Sweden`

Position: `Software Engineer`

Bzzt AB attempted to disrupt the last-mile delivery vertical of logistics
through the use of electric mopeds and electric
[tuktuks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw).

The advantage that small electric vehicles have in city centers all across
Europe cannot be matched by larger vehicles that must remain on the road and are
subject to the laws of traffic. Using small electric vehicles, with small to
medium sized boxes for carrying packages, paired with a automated software
platform, Bzzt aimed to bring a modern and intelligent software system to an
otherwise manual industry with disconnected software systems.

I was a member of a small engineering team, whose responsibilities were:

- Develop back-office delivery dashboard for the company's driver
  coordinator(s), UI written in React and backend developed in
  [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) with some parts written in the
  [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web framework.
  - System capabilities included: intelligent delivery routing (single leg and
    multi-leg), manual re-routing, real-time driver location map
- Develop warehouse package picking/sorting interface enabling bulk package
  pickup enabling processing done at warehouse instead of by customer
- Maintain mobile application delivery drivers used throughout the lifecycle of
  deliveries and their work shift

## Albert AB

[hejalbert.se](https://hejalbert.se/)

When: `December 2020 - June 2023`

Location: `Gothenburg, Sweden`

Position: `Software Engineer`

Albert AB is digital education company building mobile applications that teach
children Mathematics, Swedish, English, Programming, Geography and more.

I joined when the company was around ~15 employees and one application with
paying customers. During my first year of employment, the company grew rapidly
and launched an IPO in late 2021, further increasing the growth of our company
and user-base.

Throughout my two and a half years at Albert I worked on almost every piece of
software that was developed at the company, either directly or a supporting
service. Some highlights of my time there were:

- Developing a system for the marketing team to streamline campaign creation via
  a connective tissue of [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/),
  [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend
  application and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) backend application. This
  automated almost all aspects of a previously manual process, creating new
  landing pages, stripe configuration and more, requiring tedious and sometimes
  complex coordination between the marketing team and web team.
- Building a developer tool which served as a catalog of all the exercises in
  the companies Math application. This allowed members of the team to QA
  exercises in isolation to ensure that both changes to the exercise behaved as
  expected but also the animations worked to the quality our illustrators
  expected.
- _Albert Junior: Matte Ã„ventyret_ book release, partnered with
  [Bonnier Carlsen](https://www.bonniercarlsen.se/)
  ([press releaase](https://investors.hejalbert.se/uk/press/article?id=eeducation-albert-signs-license-agreement-with-bonnierforlagen)).
  While I did not work on this book directly, I was responsible for bringing to
  life the characters and scenes into the applications that this book was based
  on. It felt amazing to watch years of work come together into a physical
  product.

## Appirio

When: `June 2019 - November 2020`

Location: `Indianapolis, Indiana USA`

Position: `Consultant`

Appirio was my first job after graduating from Purdue University. I was hired as
a consultant whose roles and responsibilities varied from traditional Salesforce
consulting operations, including creating, managing and customizing an
organization's Salesforce CRM. I was primarily focused on the cloud services
vertical of Appirio's business where we would develop custom software solutions
to integrate into a Salesforce CRM system, using the
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) platform.

My primary project was expanding [IUPUI](https://indianapolis.iu.edu/)'s
Salesforce CRM system responsible for processing all potential students
standardized test results from the many university campuses in IUPUIs network.
This involved expanding upon an existing system utilizing a SFTP server for
handling file uploads from the different campuses administrators, a Node.js
application using PostgreSQL as a job queue to process the files and finally a
complex rules-based system (built on top of in-house developed PostgreSQL
extensions) to coordinate the data imports to Salesforce while respecting the
rules of the Salesforce CRM.
